This repository contains the paper "From Fiction to Fact â€“ Tracing the Ethical Footprints of I, Robot in Modern AI" authored by Nikhil Sharma from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo.

## Abstract
The paper examines the 2004 sci-fi film "I, Robot," directed by Alex Proyas, as a cultural artifact that envisions a future with advanced robots integrated into human society. The film is analyzed for its portrayal of societal implications and robot capabilities, focusing on aspects of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) such as verbal vs non-verbal interactions, ethics, behavior, decision-making, and learning. The paper contrasts the film's depiction of robots with current technological trends in AI and robotics, exploring the themes of technology acceptance and the ethical considerations of AI.

## Highlights
- Summary of "I, Robot" and its narrative on the role of robots in society.
- Exploration of the capabilities of robots depicted in the movie and their connection to current AI technologies.
- Discussion on the ethical implications and the trust in AI systems as portrayed in the film.
- Critical analysis of the current state of AI and robotics, in comparison to the movie's vision.
- Reflection on the future trajectory of AI and robotics, emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations and societal impact.
